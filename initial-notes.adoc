* primary service run on K8s
** Can run as Losant hosted on Google Cloud, hosted K8s, or on-prem K8s

* Gateway Edge Agent runs as a container in the target environment to pipe data to the central services

* Platform ingests massive amounts of data so needs storage to match

Kubernetes Pods:

*    API & Web Pods: These handle the user interface (the Losant Console) and the REST API that orchestrates all your application data.

*    Workflow Engine Pods: These are the "brains" of the operation. They execute the low-code logic you build in the drag-and-drop editor. In a private cluster, you can scale these pods horizontally to handle millions of simultaneous logic executions.

*    MQTT Broker Pods: These manage the real-time, bi-directional communication between your physical hardware and the platform.

*    Experience Pods: These host the custom, branded end-user portals (web apps) you build for your own customers.

It is important to note the difference between the Platform and the Edge Agent:

*    The Platform (Dashboards, API, Database) requires a full Kubernetes cluster.

*    The Edge Agent (the part on the factory floor) can run on a single Docker container or a tiny K3s node, but it does not require a full Kubernetes cluster to function.
